### In this folder, all my handwritten notes and best ever detailed notes are available, which I created while studying these Linux commands. This folder cover all the command's usage, their examples and my own tasks (questions) that are practiced that helped me a lot to understand file viewing and manipulation in Linux effectively. Have fun:)
