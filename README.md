This repository contains my personal Linux notes which is a mix of what I learned while studying with improvements I made along the way. First drafted while learning with ChatGPT and other sources and then carefully edited, reorganized, and polished by me.
 
I’ve refined these notes to make them easy to read and useful as a reference, especially for beginners or anyone getting into DevOps. I’ll keep updating them as I learn new commands and improve my understanding.
