5. Create a file named `fruits.txt`, add a fruit per line, and display its contents.
6. Add the following fruits to `devops.txt` (one per line): Apple, Mango, Banana, Cherry, Kiwi, Orange, Guava. Then append `"Pineapple"` at the end of the file.
7. Display the first three fruits from `devops.txt` in reverse order.  
8. Show the last three fruits from `devops.txt` and sort them alphabetically.  
9. Create a file called `Colors.txt`, add one color per line, and display its contents.  
10. Add these colors to `Colors.txt` (one per line): Red, Pink, White, Black, Blue, Orange, Purple, Grey. Then prepend `"Yellow"` to the beginning of the file.
11. Find and display the lines that are common between `fruits.txt` and `Colors.txt`.
